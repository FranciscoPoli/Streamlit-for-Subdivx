[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/FranciscoPoli/Streamlit-for-Subdivx/subdivxweb.py/)

A practice scraper of Subdivx.com to search some movie subtitles in spanish based on the movie/series title and 1 or 2 key words.
Scrapes through the description that the uploader of the subtitle writes and also through the comments that people write about that subtitle.
